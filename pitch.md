Hey everyone - been lurking here for a while and finally ready to share what I've been working on.

So here's the thing. AI search is eating traditional SEO alive. Google's AI Overviews are showing up in 13% of searches now (was only 6% two months ago), and everyone's freaking out because their traffic is dropping. Meanwhile ChatGPT gets 5 billion visits a month and few are optimizing for it.

I got tired of SEO tools that either:

Store all your data (sketchy)
Give you a report and make YOU do the work
Completely ignore AI search engines

So I built SearchDog AI.

What it does: Connects to your GitHub, analyzes your site, then automatically creates optimized content via pull requests. Zero data storage - everything happens in real-time and gets deleted immediately.

Why it matters: Your site gets optimized for both Google AND AI engines like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity. Because honestly, if you're not showing up when people ask AI questions about your industry, you're invisible.

The technical stuff: Uses specially trained models for AEO (AI Engine Optimization) alongside traditional SEO. Think of it as making sure you're the answer AI picks when asked about top companies in your space, not just ranking #1 on Google.

The launch deal: Opening waitlist with 75% off ($24.75 instead of $99) - only an email address required.

Happy to answer questions about the tech or privacy approach.
