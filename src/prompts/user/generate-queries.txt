IMPORTANT: {{location}}If a location is specified in the context above, include location-aware queries that would be relevant for that geographic area (e.g., "best [industry] in [location]", "[location] [industry] providers").

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure and should only have {{queryCount}} queries inside the list:
{
  "queries": ["query1", "query2", ...]
}
